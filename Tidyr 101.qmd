```{r}

```{r}
data("EuStockMarkets")
```

## Displaying one time series
Lets first show the evolution of the DAX: 
 
```{r}
ggplot(EuStockMarkets, aes(y = DAX, x = time(EuStockMarkets)))+
  geom_line()
```
Here we apply the time function to the data frame, bcs we donc have a date/the time on the dataframe (bcs in fact its a data frame of time series, so the 4 time series are collected at the same date).
Ggplot is complaining a bit, bcs u need an additionnal package to leverage the time series w/ ggplot.
